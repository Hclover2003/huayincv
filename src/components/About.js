          At school, the last day was often a somewhat wistful and mostly hyper
          gateway to a nice, lazy summer. At the community pool, despite the
          blowing snow outside, it was not that different. The last day of my
          first full session as a swim instructor, I was super proud. It was my
          first job, I was looking forward to a nice winter break, and above
          all, it was incredibly heartwarming to see the progress of both my
          students and I. <br /> <br />
          When I was younger, stepping into a pool was enough to make me wheeze,
          cry, cough, and run towards the nearest door. I was a definite land
          animal, and until the age of 12, despised anyone who tried to convince
          me otherwise. As a swim instructor, I had the chance to interact with
          many people with similar experiences, and also those with vastly
          different ones. Toddlers, seniors, competitive swimmers, and those
          learning for the first time; swimming is in no way my favourite sport,
          even today, but the experience was truly rewarding. It taught me
          different ways to lead and interact with people, and also to
          appreciate the joy and privilege of being a part of someoneâ€™s journey.
